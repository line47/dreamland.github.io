Corporate Trashland is a improvisational project from Chicago, IL. Featuring acoustic finger picking and ambiance with live sound experimentation, their music defies the traditional methods of categorizing genre and relies heavily on inspiration found in the locale of performance. The material captured during this spring tour will define their debut record. Ranging from noise to folk, their performances are both experimental and experiential.
