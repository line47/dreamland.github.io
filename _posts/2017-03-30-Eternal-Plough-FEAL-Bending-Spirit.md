### Eternal Plough
New ambient guitar project from Cleveland's Sam Goldberg who has also recorded under the name Radio People (with releases on Mexican Summer, Digitalis) and as one half of the duo Mist (w/ John Elliot of Emeralds). Visuals by Sam Goldberg will also accompany. Sam's music draws from kosmiche, drone, and even some classic american songwriting through a deconstructionist lens to offer pure, powerful, and transportative compositions
